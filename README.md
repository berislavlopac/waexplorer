# WaExplorer #

An old project of mine, originally written in 2003. Feel free to download and test it, but currently it will work only in Internet Explorer.

An in-browser UI framework consisting of XML configuration, XSLT styling and Javascript to bring them all and in the darkness bind them. Originally developed for Internet Explorer, because at that time (version 5.5) it was the only browser with XMLHTTPRequest support (long before "ajax"; we used to call it "remote scripting" back then). It was intended to work as a desktop application (hence the HTA file, which was used in the Microsoft's HyperText Application concept; again, long before Adobe Air or Mozilla XUL).

I have imported the code here to show off, and to keep it alive for future generations, but also it would be nice if someone wants to update it for the 21st century; it would be great to see it working in Mozilla, Chrome or Safari, perhaps using jQuery or some such... But I'm just daydreaming.
